//  Leap Years. 

//  Leap years are years divisible by four (like 1984 and 2004). 
//  Years divisible by 100 are not leap years (such as 1800 and 1900), 
//  unless they are divisible by 400 (like 1600 and 2000).

//  Write a program which has variables for startYear and endYear.

//  Then console.log all of the leap years between the starting year and ending 
//  year (and include starting year/ending year if they are also leap years).

//  Yes, it's all pretty confusing, but not as confusing as having July in the middle of the 
//  winter, which is what would eventually happen.
